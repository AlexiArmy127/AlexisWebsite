  <h1>Love Yourself</h1>
  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
  <p>My name is Alexis. <br> I'm creating this personal webpage as a type of starter page for a BTS fanpage and information about me. I have been an ARMY for almost 4 years and BTS and Kpop are 2 of the biggest parts of my life. <br> Love Yourself is BTS's newest album as of September 18th, 2017. And "loving yourself" is someting really important that I believe is very important for everyone to know how to do, including myself. That's one of the endless reasons why I love BTS and Kpop becasue they are teacing me how to love myself and to embrace who I am as a person. <br>
    . <br>Here are a few pictures that describe things about me, places that I have been or are still going to, and things that I have done.</p>
